âœ¨ Learning by Doing: Python Lists & Their Methods âœ¨

As part of my Cloud Data Engineering journey at Saylani SMIT under the supervision of Sir Qasim Hassan, Iâ€™ve been exploring one of the most fundamental yet powerful structures in Python â€” the List.

To strengthen my concepts, I decided to deep dive into different list methods and practice them myself. Here are the key ones I explored in detail:

ðŸ”¹ append() â†’ Add a single item at the end of the list.
 ðŸ”¹ extend() â†’ Add multiple items (iterable) to the list.
 ðŸ”¹ + operator â†’ Concatenate two lists.
 ðŸ”¹ index() â†’ Find the position of an element.
 ðŸ”¹ insert() â†’ Insert an element at a specific index.
 ðŸ”¹ pop() â†’ Remove and return an element by index.
 ðŸ”¹ remove() â†’ Remove by value.
 ðŸ”¹ reverse() â†’ Reverse the order of the list.
 ðŸ”¹ sort() â†’ Arrange elements in ascending/descending order.
 ðŸ”¹ copy() â†’ Create a shallow copy of the list.

ðŸ‘‰ Practicing each method, running experiments, and even handling errors (like remove() when the value doesnâ€™t exist) gave me much more confidence in how lists really work in Python.

This small exercise not only improved my Python basics but also built my problem-solving habit â€” which is crucial for Data Engineering.

ðŸ”— My key takeaway: Donâ€™t just read about concepts â€” implement them, break them, fix them, and learn deeply.
