ðŸš€ Today, I practiced a small mini project while learning Python in my Cloud Data Engineering course at Saylani Mass IT Training (Zaitoon Ashraf IT Park) under the guidance of Sir Qasim Hassan.

The project was about building a Student Report Card Generator.
In this task, I had to:

Take student details as strings and apply string methods

Use lists to store marks of 5 subjects

Apply conditional statements (if, elif, else) to check pass/fail and assign grades

Work with tuples for storing fixed student info (name, roll no)

Use sets for maintaining unique subject names

Perform comparison operators to calculate total and percentage

Use string concatenation and slicing for displaying formatted output

And finally, implement deep vs shallow copy to understand how data references work in Python

ðŸ“Œ Question in short:
"Create a Student Report Card System where you input student details and marks, calculate percentage, assign grade, and demonstrate Python concepts like string methods, conditionals, lists, tuples, sets, slicing, operators, and deep/shallow copy."

This small project really helped me connect theory with real-world logic and improved my problem-solving skills. Each topic became more meaningful when applied in a practical scenario.

ðŸ’¡ I strongly believe working on such mini projects is one of the best ways to build logic step by step and gain confidence for bigger challenges in programming.
