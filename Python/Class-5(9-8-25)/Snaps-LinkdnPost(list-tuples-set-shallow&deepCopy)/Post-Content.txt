ðŸ“š Learning Update â€“ Cloud Data Engineering @ SMIT (Zaitoon Ashraf IT Park) 

Todayâ€™s session under the mentorship of Sir Qasim Hassan was another exciting step in my Cloud Data Engineering journey.

We explored Lists, Tuples, and Sets in Python â€” understanding their structures, differences, and practical use cases.
Sir also walked us through the various methods for each data type, which will be incredibly useful in data manipulation tasks.

For the next class, weâ€™ve been given a self-study topic: Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy â€” a fascinating concept that Iâ€™ve already explored at home to strengthen my understanding.

Every class adds more clarity and makes me even more excited to keep building my skills in this powerful field.
