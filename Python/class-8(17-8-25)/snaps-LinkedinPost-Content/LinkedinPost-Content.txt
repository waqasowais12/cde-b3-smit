ðŸ“˜ Learning Update â€“ SMIT Cloud Data Engineering @ Zaitoon Ashraf IT Park

In our recent session under the supervision of Sir Qasim Hassan, we explored some very important Python concepts that build the foundation for problem-solving and data handling:

ðŸ”¹ Loops â€“ mastering iteration for efficiency.
 ðŸ”¹ Dictionaries â€“ understanding key-value data storage.
 ðŸ”¹ Looping on Dictionaries â€“ accessing and manipulating data effectively.
 ðŸ”¹ List & Dictionary Comprehensions â€“ writing cleaner, faster, and more readable code.

Every class strengthens not only my technical skills but also the way I approach coding challenges. Learning these concepts with practical insights from Sir Qasim Hassan makes the journey even more engaging and impactful. ðŸš€

Excited to keep improving and applying these skills in real-world projects! ðŸ’¡
