### Q7. Write a program that takes a number n as input from the user and generates the first n terms of the series formed by squaring the natural numbers.
- Sample output
- Enter a number: 6
- The first 6 terms of the series are:
- 1 4 9 16 25 36

### Q9.  Write a Python program to print the first 8 terms of an arithmetic progression starting with 3 and having a common difference of 4. The program should output the following sequence: 3 7 11 15 19 23 27 31

### Q11. Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer value. The program should calculate the sum of all the integers from 1 up to the number entered. For example, if the user enters 20, the loop will find the sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, ... 20.

### Q12.  write a program that takes a positive integer N as input and calculates the sum of the reciprocals of all numbers from 1 up to N. The program should display the final sum.

- Output of the program should be like:
- Enter a positive integer: 5
- The sum of reciprocals from 1 to 5 is: 2.28

### Q13. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number and repeats this process 5 times. The program should accumulate the numbers entered and then display the final running total.

- Sample Output:
- Enter a number: 10
- Enter a number: 15
- Enter a number: 35
- Enter a number: 40
- Enter a number: 50
- The final running total is: 150

### Q14. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer and calculates its factorial. The factorial of a positive integer 'n' is denoted as 'n!' and is calculated by multiplying all the integers from 1 to 'n' together. For example, the factorial of 5 (denoted as 5!) is calculated as 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5. 

### The program should display the factorial value if the input is a positive number, or display a message stating that the factorial does not exist for negative numbers. Additionally, for an input of zero, the program should output that the factorial of 0 is 1.

### Q15. Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a base number and an exponent, and then calculates the power of the base to the exponent. The program should not use the exponentiation operator (**) or the math.pow() function. The program should handle both positive and negative exponents.
