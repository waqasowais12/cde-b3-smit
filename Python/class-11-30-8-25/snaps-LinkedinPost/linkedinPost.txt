💡 Cracking Python Tasks with Loops & Comprehensions 🚀

In my Cloud Data Engineering journey at Saylani SMIT (Zaiton Ashraf IT Park), I recently worked on an exciting task given by my mentor Sir Qasim Hassan. The challenge was to practice Python fundamentals deeply by solving problems in two ways:
👉 Method 1: Simple Loops
👉 Method 2: Python Comprehensions

📌 Key Requirements of the Task:
1️⃣ Add an "age" key with default value None to all dictionaries using loops and comprehensions.
2️⃣ Convert a list of dictionaries into a list of lists (only values, no keys).
3️⃣ Transform a list of dicts into a dict of dicts.
4️⃣ Remove "customer id" from the final dict of dicts.

✨ Learning & Understanding:

Strengthened my grip on loops (for & while) and how they handle iteration.

Explored the power of list & dictionary comprehensions — making code shorter, cleaner, and more Pythonic.

Practiced conversions between lists and dictionaries, a must-have skill in data handling & preprocessing for real-world applications.

Learned how different methods can solve the same problem, but comprehensions often give a more efficient and elegant solution.

📂 I’ve uploaded the complete task with both solutions (loops + comprehensions) to my GitHub repo for anyone who wants to check it out or practice along:

A huge thanks to Sir Qasim Hassan for guiding us and showing how to approach problems from multiple angles — it’s helping me build a stronger foundation for my Cloud Data Engineering journey. 🙌
